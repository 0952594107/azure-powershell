  [SignInType <String>]: Specifies the user sign-in types in your directory, such as emailAddress, userName or federated. Here, federated represents a unique identifier for a user from an issuer, that can be in any format chosen by the issuer. Additional validation is enforced on issuerAssignedId when the sign-in type is set to emailAddress or userName. This property can also be set to any custom string.

OAUTH2PERMISSIONGRANT <IMicrosoftGraphOAuth2PermissionGrantAutoGenerated[]>: .
  [ClientId <String>]: The id of the client service principal for the application which is authorized to act on behalf of a signed-in user when accessing an API. Required. Supports $filter (eq only).
  [ConsentType <String>]: Indicates whether authorization is granted for the client application to impersonate all users or only a specific user. AllPrincipals indicates authorization to impersonate all users. Principal indicates authorization to impersonate a specific user. Consent on behalf of all users can be granted by an administrator. Non-admin users may be authorized to consent on behalf of themselves in some cases, for some delegated permissions. Required. Supports $filter (eq only).
  [PrincipalId <String>]: The id of the user on behalf of whom the client is authorized to access the resource, when consentType is Principal. If consentType is AllPrincipals this value is null. Required when consentType is Principal.
  [ResourceId <String>]: The id of the resource service principal to which access is authorized. This identifies the API which the client is authorized to attempt to call on behalf of a signed-in user.
  [Scope <String>]: A space-separated list of the claim values for delegated permissions which should be included in access tokens for the resource application (the API). For example, openid User.Read GroupMember.Read.All. Each claim value should match the value field of one of the delegated permissions defined by the API, listed in the publishedPermissionScopes property of the resource service principal.

PASSWORDPROFILE <IMicrosoftGraphPasswordProfileAutoGenerated>: passwordProfile
  [ForceChangePasswordNextSignIn <Boolean?>]: true if the user must change her password on the next login; otherwise false. If not set, default is false. NOTE:  For Azure B2C tenants, set to false and instead use custom policies and user flows to force password reset at first sign in. See Force password reset at first logon.
  [ForceChangePasswordNextSignInWithMfa <Boolean?>]: If true, at next sign-in, the user must perform a multi-factor authentication (MFA) before being forced to change their password. The behavior is identical to forceChangePasswordNextSignIn except that the user is required to first perform a multi-factor authentication before password change. After a password change, this property will be automatically reset to false. If not set, default is false.
  [Password <String>]: The password for the user. This property is required when a user is created. It can be updated, but the user will be required to change the password on the next login. The password must satisfy minimum requirements as specified by the user’s passwordPolicies property. By default, a strong password is required.
